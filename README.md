# Immune-Kit-Development
This is made for people who do not want to edit the mod code, or don't know how to.
All you have to do is run the program, follow the steps, copy all the code it gives you (from top to bottom) and put it into one document. Then you can add the kit!

Then upload the mod to your server and your done!
